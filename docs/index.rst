     <h2>Why Use usaa.com/identity for Verification?</h2>
     <p>
       With cybersecurity threats on the rise, verifying your identity is essential for protecting sensitive financial and personal data. <strong>USAA</strong> ensures that only authorized individuals can access accounts by requiring identity confirmation through <strong><a href="https://www.usaa.com/identity" target="_blank">usaa.com/identity</a></strong>.
     </p>
     <p>
       Whether you’re registering for the first time, signing in from a new device, or updating account settings, this verification process offers a secure way to confirm your identity, preventing fraud and unauthorized access.
     </p>

     <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Identity Verification</h2>
     <p>To verify your identity through USAA, follow these simple steps:</p>
     <ol>
       <li>Visit <strong><a href="https://www.usaa.com/identity" target="_blank">usaa.com/identity</a></strong> in your browser (mobile or desktop).</li>
       <li>Sign in using your USAA username and password.</li>
       <li>You’ll be prompted to enter a one-time code sent to your registered email or mobile device.</li>
       <li>Input the code and proceed to confirm your identity.</li>
       <li>In some cases, additional questions may be asked regarding your account details or recent transactions.</li>
       <li>Once verified, you’ll gain full access to your USAA dashboard and account services.</li>
     </ol>

     <h2>What to Do If Verification Fails</h2>
     <ul>
       <li><strong>No code received?</strong> Wait a few minutes, check spam folders, or request a resend via your preferred method.</li>
       <li><strong>Wrong info entered?</strong> Retry after verifying your login credentials and contact support if you’re locked out.</li>
       <li><strong>Still having trouble?</strong> Use the USAA mobile app, live chat, or call USAA customer service for help.</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Staying Safe During Verification</h2>
     <p>
       Always ensure you’re on the correct site: <strong>https://www.usaa.com/identity</strong>. Look for the HTTPS lock icon to confirm a secure connection. Never share your password or verification code with anyone.
     </p>

     <p>
       USAA will never contact you asking for personal information such as full Social Security numbers or passwords via email, text, or phone. Be cautious of phishing scams and report suspicious activity immediately.
     </p>

     <p>
       For added protection, enable multi-factor authentication, create strong passwords, and review your account for unusual activity regularly.
     </p>
